### General Information
The Grand Raid de la Réunion, also called La diagonale des fous (The Bishops'/Madmen's Diagonal) is a mountain ultramarathon race. The race takes place annually in October on Réunion island, a French overseas department in the Indian Ocean, situated between Madagascar and Mauritius. The 162 km route with 9643 m of elevation gain is reputed to be highly challenging, brutally difficult and one of the hardest footraces in the world.
